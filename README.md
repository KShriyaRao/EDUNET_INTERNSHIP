Description
This repository contains the implementation of a Crop and Fertilizer Recommendation System using Machine Learning. The system utilizes a dataset to suggest appropriate fertilizers for various crops based on factors like soil type and environmental conditions. Note: The CSV dataset has been removed for privacy reasons.

Files
crop_recommendation.ipynb: The main Google Colab notebook containing code for loading, exploring, and analyzing the dataset. It includes steps for data preprocessing and setting up the model.

WEEK-1.docx: A Word document containing theory questions related to Machine Learning concepts, including explanations of ML, Supervised ML, Regression, and Classification.

Installation
Clone the Repository:

Open Google Colab: Open the crop_recommendation.ipynb in Google Colab to start running the code.

Upload the Dataset:Please upload your own CSV file manually in Colab before running the code.

Usage
The notebook is designed to load and preprocess the dataset, followed by applying machine learning algorithms to recommend fertilizers for different crops.

Ensure that you upload your dataset in Colab before running the code.
